# Neural Network Visualization with Network Dissection

## Overview

This repository showcases a neural network model along with the implementation of Network Dissection, an explainable machine learning concept. Network Dissection allows us to visualize and understand how the layers within the neural network are learning and representing information.

## About the Model

- **Model Architecture**: Our neural network is designed with a specific architecture that includes 12 convolution layers.
- **Dataset**: For training and testing the model, we have used the Pokemon dataset (Available on kaggle).
- **Training Process**: The model was trained using adam as an optimizer and categorical_crossentropy as a loss function.
- **Model Performance**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.

## Network Dissection

- **Explanation**: Network Dissection is a powerful concept that enhances our understanding of neural networks. It helps us interpret and visualize how the different layers in our network are learning features and representations.
- **Visualization Tools**: To achieve Network Dissection, we have employed various visualization techniques and tools, including matplotlib.
- **Interpretation**: Through Network Dissection, we've gained valuable insights into our model. For example, what pixels are responsible for the prediction in the model.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**: You will need the following software and libraries:
   - Python 3.9.13
   - Numpy
   - TensorFlow
